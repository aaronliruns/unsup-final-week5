# Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning Final Project - Week 5
### How dimensionality reduction improves clustering performance?
### Aaron Li

In this project we will build on some unsupervised learning concepts by implementing clustering, which attempts to group objects together based on similarity. With unsupervised models, clustering achieves this without using any labels. MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) database of handwritten digits will be used for the exercises.
